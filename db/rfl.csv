Notices stimuli,"<p>Look for any changes in behaviour which are not reflex responses, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>stilling (a momentary pause)</li>
<li>turning (head, eyes, or body)</li>
<li>lip/tongue movement</li>
<li>an eye flicker</li>
<li>a change in breathing</li>
<li>tensing or relaxing (you may need to be in close physical contact in order to perceive this).</li>
</ul>"
Reacts to close contact with familiar adult,"<p>Look for any changes in behaviour which are not reflex responses, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>stilling (a momentary pause)</li>
<li>turning (head, eyes, or body)</li>
<li>lip/tongue movement</li>
<li>an eye flicker</li>
<li>a change in breathing</li>
<li>tensing or relaxing (you may need to be in close physical contact in order to perceive this).</li>

<li>open mouth/tongue movement</li>
<li>moving fingers, e.g. in sheepskin&nbsp;</li>
<li>a kick.</li>
</ul>"
Demonstrates brief memory for previously presented stimulus,"<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a decline of interest when the stimulus is repeated</li>
<li>recovery of interest when a new stimulus is offered.</li>
</ul>"
Responds to familiar voice or other personal identifier,"<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>stilling/tensing or relaxing</li>
<li>smiling or a change in facial expression</li>
<li>turning of the head</li>
<li>fleeting eye contact</li>

<li>movement of eyes, lips, tongue</li>
<li>vocalisation</li>
<li>tensing/relaxing</li>

</ul>"
Supported 1:1 turn-taking with adult,<p>Look for signs of the learner co-operating or anticipating.</p>
Responds to own name,"<p>Look for responses as in step 6.</p>
<p>Note: Take care that the learner is not responding to other cues such as tone of voice, the staff’s own reaction, a touch, etc. This step requires a response which is different to step 5 above.</p>"
Responds consistently to one stimulus,<p>Look for the learner responding in the same way each time a stimulus is presented.</p>
Briefly follows moving stimulus,"<p>Look for the learner following a stimulus with his/her eyes.</p>"
Shows behaviour which can be interpereted as rejection to some stimuli,"<p>Look for the learner signalling a desire to stop the activity or interaction; for example, by turning away, pulling a face or pushing.</p>"
Responds differently to different stimuli,"<p>During pauses between stimuli, observe whether the learner appears to be waiting; for example, by tensing up, holding his/her breath, beginning to smile or laugh (for a liked stimulus) – the learner may be anticipating the next repeat.</p>"
Terminates interaction with an adult,"<p>Note how the learner ‘signals’ the end of an interaction, for example, by turning away or averting the eyes.</p>"
Anticipates repetitively presented stimulus,"<p>After repeated alternate presentations, look for the learner turning his/her eyes and/or head to the next position before the stimulus appears there.</p>
<p>When sound, vibration or light, etc., is presented in a pulse pattern, look for the learner anticipating the next presentation; for example, the body may stiffen or the eyes widen before the next presentation of a sound.</p>"
Objects to termination of interaction,"<p>Look for strategies used by the learner to signal that he/she wants the ‘exchange’ to continue; for example, by eye movement, body movement or vocalisation.</p>"
Aided exploration of the environment,"<p>Look for the learner:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving his/her fingers or hand</li>
<li>smelling or trying to lick/mouth objects</li>
<li>actively exploring objects in turn.</li>
</ul>"
Anticipates within social routines,"<p>Look for signs of anticipation (see 14), as well as smiling or laughing.</p>"
Redirects attention to second object,<p>Look for the learner losing interest in the first object and focusing attention on a new item.</p>
Random activities cause effect,"<p>Look for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>independent (but random) movement of hands or fingers</li>
<li>active exploration by the mouth or other parts of the body</li>
<li>the learner’s reaction to any ‘effects’ created.</li>
</ul>"
Looks briefly after a disappearing object,<p>Look for the learner looking after the object as it disappears.</p>
Action on reactive environment,"<p>Look for the learner making attempts to create an action or effect.</p>"
Communicates ‘more’,"<p>Look for the learner vocalising/moving/changing facial expression, for example:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>widening the eyes, staring at an object</li>
<li>moving the arms</li>
<li>mouth opening, vocalisation</li>
<li>reaching towards an object, which may be interpreted as a request for more.</li>
</ul>"
Contingency responding,"<p>Look for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>the learner making something happen independently</li>
<li>the rate of action increasing when it has an effect; for example, kicking increases when it causes a mobile to move</li>
<li>whether the learner waits for a reward before pressing a switch again, etc. Refer to Contingency Awareness (26).</li>
</ul>"
Purposeful action on everyday environment,"<p>Look for the learner deliberately making things happen in an everyday environment.</p>"
Changes behaviour in response to interesting event nearby,"<p>Look for the learner ‘noticing’ a second event/stimulus and reacting or changing behaviour; for example, by turning, attending or vocalising.</p>"
Contingency awareness,"<p>Look for the learner acting with intent – and more consistently; for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>waiting for a reward to end before trying again, linking a particular action</li>
<li>with its consequence</li>
<li>a change in facial expression or concentration</li>
<li>increasing accuracy.</li>
</ul>"
Intentional exploration of the environment,"<p>Look for any form of exploration; for example, the learner looking around, reaching out, or a body movement if on the floor.</p>"
Communicates ‘more’ and ‘no more’ through 2 different consistent actions,"<p>Look for a response which may indicate ‘no more’; for example, eyes closing, turning away, closing of the mouth. Reinforce and build upon this, responding consistently on every occasion.</p>"
‘Looks’ backwards/forwards between two objects (knows two objects are present),"<p>Look for the learner attending to, or feeling each of two objects in turn and redirecting his/her attention.</p>"
Perseveres by repeating action for reward in social game,"<p>Look for the learner repeating a request for more, despite a delay.</p>"
Repeats action when first attempt unsuccessful,"<p>Look for an example, such as:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>the learner missing a switch the first time, or failing to depress it sufficiently, but trying again and succeeding.</li>
</ul>"
Attracts attention,<p>Look for the learner trying to attract attention of familiar staff nearby.</p>
Initiates a social game,"<p>Look for the learner attempting to initiate a game through a signal used in 30 or by other means.</p>"
Object permanence,"<p>Look for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>the eyes looking towards the point of disappearance for a brief time</li>
<li>stilling, head turning, a facial expression when a noise stops</li>
<li>searching briefly by feeling a tray for an item removed from grasp</li>
<li>increased duration of searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the learner has a significant visual impairment, object permanence may not appear until further down the Routemap.</p>"
Does 2 different actions in sequence to get reward,"<p>Look for a decrease in time between the two actions. These should be done in sequence rather than pausing after the first action.</p>"
Selects from 2 or more item,"<p>Look for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>increased eye contact with one item</li>
<li>a greater change in facial expression in response to one noise when two are presented in an alternating pattern. Leave enough time for any responses</li>
<li>an increased level of activity (e.g. arm or leg movements) during a pause following a taste of one particular food.</li>
</ul>"
Communicates choice to attentive adult,"<p>Look for:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>smiling</li>
<li>eye pointing</li>
<li>reaching</li>
<li>turning towards a preferred item.</li>
</ul>"
Modifies action when repeating action does not work,<p>Look for the learner repeating an action then trying a new or modified action in an attempt to get a response.</p>
Deliberately gains attention of another person to satisfy a need,"<p>Look for all unprompted attempts to gain adult attention; in particular at times when an adult is not expecting them. Strategies can be taught (e.g. pressing a particular switch which could be present on a tray or chair), but they must come to be used on the learner’s terms not just after adult encouragement.</p>"
Shares attention,"<p>Look for the learner gaining attention of an adult, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>looking towards or indicating a stimulus and then looking back to the adult</li>
<li>stilling to a sound, or moving to music, and then looking back to the adult</li>
<li>touching an item and then feeling for the adult’s hand.</li>
<li>Look for the learner showing pleasure in sharing, or trying to ‘comment’ on the item.</li>
</ul>"
Expresses preference for items not present via symbolic means,<p>Look for the learner giving attention to a symbol for a preferred item and then waiting for the item to be presented.</p>
Early problem solving – tries new strategy when old one fails,"<p>Look for a reduction in the time during which the learner tries the original action in order to gain a reward. When failure of the original strategy is recognised, and as soon as an attempt at a new action is made, a reward should be given. As the learner becomes aware that the increased original action will not work, a new strategy will be attempted more quickly<br></p>"
Initiates actions to achieve desired result (exerting autonomy in variety of contexts),"<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>attempts to gain adult attention (as above) and make a request; for example, vocalising for attention and then touching a symbol on a tray.</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.618;"">the learner timing switch-presses to get a desired result in a computer programme.</span></li>
