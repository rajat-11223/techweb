They talk about their experiences of ICT both inside and outside school.",L2

,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can with help discuss which commands may be required to move a floor robot in a specific direction. For example, pupil: - inputs at least 2 commands to move a floor robot in a desired direction. - can discuss how he will move radio-controlled toy through at least 2 obstacles. - demonstrates their suggestion and moves radio controlled toy through 2 obstacles.",b
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can use a simple data programme to record and share ideas. For example, pupil can, with some help, use a simple data programme to store collected information about favourite pets.",c
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can with help save their work. For example, pupil is able to open a shared folder to save their work.",d
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can use ICT to sort out and classify information. For example, pupil is able to use images /digital photographs to develop a display about an event /activity he/she or others have taken part in.",e
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupils use ICT to save information and to find and use appropriate stored information, following straightforward lines of enquiry. They use ICT to generate, develop, organise and present their work. They share and exchange their ideas with others. They use sequences of instructions to control devices and achieve specific outcomes. They make appropriate choices when using ICT-based models or simulations to help them find things out and solve problems. They describe their use of ICT and its use outside school.",L3
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can discuss when and where ICT control devices may be used outside of school. For example, pupil is able to describe how and where a door intercom system may be used or located.",a
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can compare different instructions used to make a robot follow two or more commands. For example, pupil after inputting his commands, compares the results to decide which were the most efficient instructions.",b
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can without support save information that may be used by others. For example, as part of a group activity pupil enters and inputs shared information into a recognised database.",c
,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupil can with occasional help use a word processor to present information. For example, pupil: - adds text to a speech bubble attached to an image. - uses a ‘presentation package’ to present information. - places a sequence of images in correct order to present as a slide show.",d

,ICT,,Exchanging and sharing information,,"Pupils understand the need for care in framing questions when collating, finding and interrogating information. They interpret their findings, question plausibility and recognise that poor-quality information leads to unreliable results. They add to, amend and combine different forms of information from a variety of sources. They use ICT to present information in different forms and show they are aware of the intended audience and the need for quality in their presentations. They exchange information and ideas with others in a variety of ways, including using e-mail. They use ICT systems to control events in a predetermined manner and to sense physical data. They use ICT-Based models and simulations to explore patterns and relationships, and make predictions about the consequences of their decisions. They compare their use of ICT with other methods and with its use outside school.",L4

For example, pupil: - compares own results with others using an on screen image showing designated or suggested routes. - can share/ playback recording of a sequence for others to listen to. - tells a story to a small group supported by their soundtrack recorded on composition software.",c
